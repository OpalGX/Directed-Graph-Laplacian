# Directed-Graph-Laplacian
The script 'main.m' generates figures and tables presented in the paper "Directed Network Laplacians and Random Graph Models".

'load_data.m' - reads in the network data and output the largest connected component it into a graph object.

'optimal_g.m' - finds the optimal parameter g for the Magnetic Laplacian.

'meigenmaps.m' - impliments the Magnetic Laplacian algorithm.

'levels.m' - impliments the Trophic Laplacian algorithm.

'model_comparison.m' - compares the likelihood of pRDRG model with the trphic Laplacian model.
