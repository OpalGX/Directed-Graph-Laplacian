# Directed-Graph-Laplacian
The main script 'main.m' generates figures and tables presented in the paper "Directed Network Laplacians and Random Graph Models".

load_data.m  Reads in the network data and output the largest connected component it into a graph object

multilevel_model.m - Generates synthetic network from the trophic RDRG model

generateRDRG.m -  Generates synthetic network from the directed pRDRG model

optimal_g.m - Finds the optimal parameter g for the Magnetic Laplacian

meigenmaps.m - Implements the Magnetic Laplacian algorithm

levels.m - Implements the Trophic Laplacian algorithm

model_comparison.m - Compares the likelihood of pRDRG model with the trphic Laplacian model
